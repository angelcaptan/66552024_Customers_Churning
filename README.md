# 66552024_Customers_Churning

## Overview
This project focused on developing a churn prediction model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) through a Functional API. The goal was to assist telecom operators in identifying customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive measures to reduce customer attrition. The project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and the creation of an interactive platform for real-time predictions.

The Steps Enacted Include:
1.Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & RandomForestClassifier for feature importance analysis.

3. Model Development Using an MLP Classifier Model
   
4. Model Evaluation using Auc Score, Accuracy Score, Confusion matrix, ROC curve and Classification report
   
5. Model Deployment using Streamlit
   
6. Video Demonstration demonstrating the application's functionality. Link :
